<p>As part of my current project (for controlling industrial machines) I need to replace the Windows XP shell with my own application. We have opted to run the app directly from a memory card (for a number of reasons) and this worked fine until I tried it on a fresh machine yesterday. XP itself is installed on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">Solid State Drive (SSD)</a>, but we have already tested this before and had no problems with it.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, and a hint provided by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.embedded/browse_thread/thread/86c374138163d4b0">this thread</a>, I found the problem: we&rsquo;re using a USB memory card reader and USB devices can take some time to get on their feet, so trying to run our app at start-up was a big race condition. The reason we hadn&rsquo;t spotted this before is pure fluke &ndash; I guess the drive I was using yesterday was just that bit faster than the ones I&rsquo;ve used previously.</p>
<p>So, quick fix is to use an app on the hard drive as the shell that just pauses for a few seconds (10 seems to work) before running the real shell. A more robust solution will be to poll the memory card (probably every second) until it springs into life.</p>
<p>Ah well, if this stuff was easy everybody would be doing it :)</p>
