<p>As mentioned in the <a href="/2014/09/01/Android-enabling-gzip-compression-over-HTTPS.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;I access my Azure-hosted service from Android over HTTPS. This worked just fine on my Android 4.1 phone, but when I tested on a version 2.2 emulator I received an error:</p>

<p>This happens because Android 2.2 (and presumably lower versions too) does not accept the Azure SSL certificate.</p>
<p>The really simple solution is to just ignore 2.2: according to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">Android Dashboards</a> 2.2 now accounts for only 0.7% of the install base (and shrinking). However, the rest of the app works fine (mainly due to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html">Android Support Library</a>) and so I wanted to fix this if possible.</p>
<h2>The *bad* solution</h2>
<p>We can just trust all certificates and that will fix it, right? Well, yes, but you're opening yourself (well, the user) up to man in the middle attacks - if someone can insert themself between the user and the server, returning a valid (and now trusted) certificate, they can intercept all the encrypted HTTPS traffic.</p>
<p>I'm not even going to post sample code for this.</p>
<p>Don't do it.</p>
<h2>The correct solution</h2>
<p>What we want to do is just trust our known Azure certificate.</p>
<p>The way we do this is to create a KeyStore containing our certificate, and then use that to create a SSLSocketFactory, which the client then uses when it needs to create the connection to our server.</p>
<p>Rather than reproduce it completely, the approach is described <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2013/10/21/accessing-azure-mobile-services-from-android-2-2-froyo-devices.aspx">here</a> (as well as a number of questions on StackOverflow, eg. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2642777/trusting-all-certificates-using-httpclient-over-https">this one</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the 0.7% of my users are happy :)</p>
