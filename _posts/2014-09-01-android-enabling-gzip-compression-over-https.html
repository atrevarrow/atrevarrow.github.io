<p>I have an Android app that talks to a Web API hosted in Azure to retrieve blobs of JSON - this works just fine out of the box using the following client code to initiate the connection:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; first-line: 1; tab-size: 4; toolbar: false; ">private InputStream openUrlStream(String url) throws IOException {
    URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
    return connection.getInputStream();
}
</pre>
<p>Now, because my JSON can get reasonably large I wanted to enable gzip compression. I get this for free on the server, so how do I modify the client to turn this on...?</p>
<p>It turns out that the <em>HttpURLConnection</em> created for you by <em>URL.openConnection</em>&nbsp;already adds the correct header to the request:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 4; toolbar: false; ">Accept-Encoding: gzip</pre>
<p>and automatically decompresses the response for you (the stream returned from <em>connection.getInputStream</em> is actually a <em>GZIPInputStream</em>).</p>
<p>Excellent. I hooked up Fiddler as a proxy for the Android emulator to verify, and I could see the gzip header in the request and the compressed response; I could also see much smaller chunks of data in my Azure dashboard.</p>
<h2>The spanner in the works</h2>
<p>So now, like a good Web API citizen, I wanted to secure my connections using https - that's fine I thought, I should just need to change the url to https:// and it will all just carry on working. Erm, no.</p>
<p>First off, the Azure certificate is not in the certificate store on older versions of Android (that's going to be my next blog post!)</p>
<p>The second problem is that the <em>HttpsURLConnection</em> created for you for a https:// url does not send the gzip request header. Ok, that's easy enough to add:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; first-line: 1; tab-size: 4; toolbar: false; ">    connection.setRequestProperty("accept-encoding", "gzip");</pre>
<p>However, because we have manually added the gzip header we also need to handle decompressing the data. We can do that by wrapping the response stream in our own&nbsp;<em>GZIPInputStream</em>, giving the following full solution:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; first-line: 1; tab-size: 4; toolbar: false; ">private InputStream openUrlStream(String url) throws IOException {
    URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
    fixRequestCompression(connection);
    return fixResponseStreamDecompression(connection, connection.getInputStream());
}

private InputStream fixResponseStreamDecompression(URLConnection connection, InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    // Because we had to manually request gzip compression, we also have to manually decompress the resultant zipped stream
    String contentEncoding = connection.getContentEncoding();
    if ((contentEncoding != null) &amp;&amp; contentEncoding.equalsIgnoreCase("gzip")) {
        if (!(inputStream instanceof GZIPInputStream)) {
            return new GZIPInputStream(inputStream);
        }
    }

    return inputStream;
}

private void fixRequestCompression(URLConnection connection) {
    if (connection instanceof HttpsURLConnection) {
        // gzip compression is enabled by default for HttpURLConnection, but not Https
        connection.setRequestProperty("accept-encoding", "gzip");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Notice we only add the request header if it's https, and only wrap the response stream if it is actually compressed and not already being decompressed - this allows the code to work unchanged for http urls.</p>
<p>Et voila, a compressed and secured Web API call.</p>
