<p>I&rsquo;m used to working either as a contractor or permy for other companies, normally on projects of 1-6 months duration, in technology areas I know well. In these scenarios, I can usually estimate quite accurately.</p>
<p>However, my current project is a departure for me. I am writing some software on my own, for a customer (ie. I&rsquo;m not working within a company), in an industry I didn&rsquo;t know (manufacturing) using technologies I had never really used before (WPF/WCF/XP embedded/real-time). Oh, and requirements (as always) weren&rsquo;t exactly set in stone (this isn&rsquo;t the customer&rsquo;s fault &ndash; it&rsquo;s a fact of life that if you&rsquo;re writing something new people don&rsquo;t know what they want until they see something to base their ideas on).</p>
<p>The customer needs to know up-front roughly whether they can afford it, and if they&rsquo;re going to have something timely enough to meet their business needs (ie. they may have a limited window of opportunity). So, how do you come up with an estimate of how long it&rsquo;s going to take?</p>
<p>Well, I broke it down into what seemed like logical chunks/modules/sub-tasks, estimated those and came up with 4 months&hellip; fine, everybody&rsquo;s happy&hellip; except that was a year ago! I was a factor of 3 out! WTF!</p>
<p>Now, I know developers are notoriously ambitious with their estimates but as I said, I&rsquo;m normally not too shabby. However, I hadn&rsquo;t factored in just how much time it would take to gain experience in the new stuff. And I don&rsquo;t just mean <em>learn</em> them (eg. I thought I had already <em>learned</em> WPF) &ndash; I mean use them, in anger, on a real project, solving real problems.</p>
<p>So, lesson learned. Estimating is fine if you have <em>real</em> experience in everything you&rsquo;re using on the project. For anything new, take your original estimate and multiply it by 3 :)</p>
