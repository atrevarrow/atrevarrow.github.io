I've been writing software since I was 11 (which was a while ago now) and I still get a kick out of making computerised monkeys do my bidding.

I am a skilled and highly motivated software engineer with almost twenty years of commercial design and programming experience.
During this time I have been involved in all aspects of developing software, from initial requirements and design through to testing and support.
I have worked on a wide range of projects, from device drivers to GUIs, on a variety of platforms.
